# Scientific-Pathfinding
Repo created for solving path problems using advanced algorithms and data visualization.

This project was created over the weekend (6/7/2020) for my ORNL engineering application.

I have noticed an issue on some Windows 10 JREs with the JVM heap space being too small (the GUI creates a large amount of controls). To fix this issue you may launch the application with:
   $>java -Xms1024M -jar "Topo Search Demo.jar"
